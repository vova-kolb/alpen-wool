Create a one-page selling landing page for handmade wool blankets and throws. The design should evoke warmth, comfort, and authenticity while maintaining a modern, minimalist aesthetic.

The layout should be visually appealing and optimized for mobile and desktop. Use a clean, user-friendly structure with high-quality visuals and intuitive navigation to enhance engagement and trust. Ensure clear calls-to-action that guide users towards making a purchase or contacting the seller.
